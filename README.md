# Forge Starter: Your Minimal Forge Framework Base

Welcome to Forge Starter! This project is designed to be the **lightest possible starting point** for building web applications with the Forge PHP framework. It includes only the essential components to get you up and running quickly, keeping your project lean and efficient.

## What's Included?

Forge Starter comes pre-configured with the following core Forge framework modules:

- **ForgePackageManager:** The Forge package manager itself! Use this to easily install and manage additional modules to expand your project's functionality.
- **ForgeErrorHandler:** Provides robust error and exception handling, giving you helpful error pages during development and graceful error handling in production.

This minimal setup gives you a solid foundation for building web applications while keeping your project size incredibly small (under 240KB!). Perfect for projects where performance, simplicity, and a clear understanding of your codebase are key.

## Installation

Getting started with Forge Starter is easy:

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url] your-project-name
    cd your-project-name
    ```

    _(Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of your Forge Starter repository and `your-project-name` with your desired project directory name.)_

2.  **Install dependencies using ForgePackageManager:**

    ```bash
    php install.php
    php forge.php package:install-project
    ```

    This command will read the `forge.lock.json` file (or `forge.json` if it's a fresh project) and install the necessary Forge framework components and any modules listed in your `forge.json` manifest. This sets up your project with the Forge core and the modules included in Forge Starter.

3.  **Set up your environment:**

    - **Environment variables:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your application's environment variables (database settings, application URL, etc.) in the `.env` file.
    - **Generate application key (optional but recommended for security):**
      ```bash
      php forge.php key:generate
      ```
      _(This command generates a unique application key and sets it in your `.env` file. This is important for security, especially in production environments.)_

4.  **Serve your application (for development):**
    You can use the built-in Forge development server:

    ```bash
    php forge.php serve
    ```

    This will start a development server, by default serving your application at `http://localhost:8080`. You can customize the host and port:

    ```bash
    php forge.php serve 127.0.0.1 9090
    ```

    This will serve your application at `http://127.0.0.1:9090`.

    Alternatively, you can use PHP's built-in web server directly:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public
    ```

    Then, access your application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üí° Adding More Modules

One of the strengths of Forge is its modularity. You can easily extend your Forge Starter project by installing additional modules using the ForgePackageManager.

To install a new module, use the `forge package:require` command:

```bash
php forge.php package:require [module-name]
```

(Replace [module-name] with the name of the Forge module you want to install, e.g., forge package:require ForgeDatabaseModule. You can find a list of available modules at the [Forge Modules Repository](https://github.com/forge-engine/modules).)

### Other Useful Forge Commands:

The Forge CLI tool provides several commands to help you manage your project:
